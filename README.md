# WindEdit
A high performace text editor for huge file and long line.

_Hello WindEdit :rose:, hello world!_

**If you want a high performance SSH/Telnet/Serial/Shell client, you can try [WindTerm](https://github.com/kingtoolbox/windterm).**

# Background
When developing [WindTerm](https://github.com/kingToolbox/WindTerm), I need a colored text component, so WindEdit was created as a by-product. Hope it is a good by-product.
